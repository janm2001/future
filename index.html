                        <h2 class="center">Things I would want to achieve</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Play sport proffesionally</li>
                            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/sports.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>
                                I always liked to play sports, and it was my dream since I was little to play some sport proffesionally.</p>
                                 <p>It doesn't matter which but I really want to see if I can compete with best athletes in the world.</p>
                                  <p>The sport I like to play the most is Basektball but I think that is a bit late for that but I would have a good chance in Triathlon but it's a really expansive sport.
                            </p>

                            <li>Become a Web Developer</li>
                            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/web.png" alt="">
                            <p>
                                I started learning to make website 4 years ago and first it was really hard because my websites looked really bad and I didn't have the skill yet to make them beautiful, but I think they are fine now even though they can always be better</p>
                                <p>to become a Junior Web Developer after I finish High School I would need to learn a lot of new features like Javascript Frameworks and have more projects in general.
                            </p>

                            <p>I will be going to the university that will help me in my quest.</p>
                            <p><a class="btn btn-danger btn-lg" href="university.html">TVZ</a></p>

                            <li>Write a book</li>
                            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/book.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>This is one of the hardest things to achieve because I will do this when I have more experience in life and I would like to teach people in my book what I have learned through my life and what leasons can I teach them so they can avoid making mistakes I made.</p>
                            <p>I would like to be remembered in history so writing a book would be of great help if it gets popular.</p>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class=" col-12 col-lg-6">
                        <h2 class="center">Places I would like to visit</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Paris</li>
                            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/paris.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>Paris is one of the most visited cities in the world and that is for a good reason.</p>
                            <p>I always wanted to go there because I would like to learn more about french language and I will like to explore their culture</p>
                            <p>It would be nice to try french vine and cheese and to how people live there.</p>

                            <li>Rome</li>
                            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/rome.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>This city is not that far so I would probably visit it really soon.</p>
                            <p>I really like Italy because I feel in love with their lanugage because some of their songs are just so beautiful.</p>
                            <p>Ti Amo is my favorite Italian song and it's just brilliant <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo_Ph9GQjWw">Song link</a></p>
                            <p>In general Italy has a reach culture and they are famous for some many things that I would like to explore.</p>

                            <li>Tokyo</li>
                            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/tokyo.jpg" alt="">
                            <p>Japan is the country of the future and people in Japan are different from any other country</p>
                            <p>They have a lot of products that you can't find anywhere else in the world.</p>
                            <p>Food is really different there and I love to try different things.</p>
                            <p>Lastly they have really cute building and a rich history.</p>
