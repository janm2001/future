                    <p>Information Technology study prepares prospective IT engineers to independently do the jobs related to organisation, application and development of advanced information technologies, as well as to devise and find designer and multimedia solutions. Due to ever growing interest in the IT study, the quota of full-time students is regularly reached by the end of summer term enrolment deadline, and some students, especially those interested in IT Design, opt for part-time mode of study (as self-funded students). They have the same study programme as full-time students but the courses are suited to the students who are employed.</p>
                    <p>The quality of the study programme is recognised by business and industry, resulting in employment of our students immediately after receiving Bachelorâ€™s of Engineering degree, and often in their pursuit of education at graduate studies. Cooperation with information industry is very close throughout the studies, which helps students to choose and develop their professional profile so that IT engineers can easily find a job as development engineers, in a number of public and private companies, in industry, representative offices, project organisations or state institutions. More active students manage to get such jobs while still studying.</p>
